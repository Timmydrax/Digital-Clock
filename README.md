# Digital-Clock

**A digital clock is a timekeeping device that displays the time in numerical digits instead of using hands on a circular dial.**

Unlike analog clocks, digital clocks show the hours, minutes, and seconds as numbers.

They are commonly found in electronic devices, watches, and household appliances.
